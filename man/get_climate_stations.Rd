\arguments{
\item{aoi}{list of length 2 containing an XY coordinate pair, 2 column matrix/dataframe of XY coordinates, sf or Terra SpatVector point/polygon/linestring geometry}

\item{radius}{numeric, search radius in miles around given point (or the centroid of a polygon). If an AOI is given, radius defaults to 20 miles. If no AOI is given, then default is NULL.}

\item{county}{character, indicating the county to query}

\item{division}{numeric, indicating the water division to query}

\item{station_name}{character, surface water station name}

\item{site_id}{character vector or list of characters of climate station site IDs}

\item{water_district}{numeric, indicating the water district to query}

\item{api_key}{character, optional. If more than maximum number of requests per day is desired, an API key can be obtained from CDSS.}
}
\value{
dataframe of climate data station info
}
\description{
Make a request to the climatedata/climatestations/ endpoint to locate climate stations by AOI, county, division, station name, Site ID or water district.
